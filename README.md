- Tokenization
- Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging

- Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## Tokenization
Split paragraphs and sentences into smaller units for easier processing. 

## POS Tagging
Categorizing words in text in correspondence to a particular part of speech, based on its definition and context.

## Lemmatization
